# Config

See [this](https://nikiv.dev/config) for details.

I write lots of code and I describe my workflow [here](https://nikiv.dev/how-i-code).

My entire workflow is based around Karabiner and generator I wrote for it called [kar](https://github.com/nikivdev/kar). I share snapshots of my config [here](https://github.com/nikivdev/snaps/blob/main/kar/config.ts). Can see [this PR to Karabiner](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements/pull/4396) for more context.

This repo holds public config I am sharing, internal stuff is in `i/` folder in here git ignored. 

I use [flow](https://github.com/nikivdev/flow) to manage everything.
