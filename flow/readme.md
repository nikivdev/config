# Flow Config

Experimenting driving my entire config through [flow](https://github.com/nikivdev/flow).

The goal is to fully bootstrap my mac by getting [flow](https://github.com/nikivdev/flow) CLI, doing auth. Then syncing up configs from remote and applying them.

flow will heavily use [flox](https://flox.dev) to make this happen.

The config here is snapshot of my actual config at some point in time. I update snapshots at times stripping away private things.
