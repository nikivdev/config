# Config

See [this](https://nikiv.dev/config) for details.

Goal is to fully drive config from [flow](flow) but not yet there.

I keep my [karabiner](https://nikiv.dev/karabiner) config private but do occasional [snapshot](https://github.com/nikivdev/snaps/blob/main/config/kar/config.ts). Can [reach out](https://x.com/nikivdev) if you have questions or want to see latest version of the config.

My goal is for anyone to be able to have full replication of my mac setup on fresh mac but not yet there.

## Tasks

Using [flow](flow), run `f` to see available tasks.

## Contributing

Make issues with bugs/features or PRs. Unfinished work will be merged too if the idea is good. Software or docs can always be better. Thank you. Can see [this](https://nikiv.dev/how-i-code) for how to code fast with AI.
