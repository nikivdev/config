# Config

See [this](https://nikiv.dev/config) for details.

I keep my [karabiner](https://nikiv.dev/karabiner) config private but do occasional [snapshots](https://github.com/nikivdev/snaps). Can [reach out](https://x.com/nikivdev) if you have questions or want to see latest version of the config.

My goal is for anyone to be able to have full replication of my mac setup on fresh mac but not yet there.

## Setup

Install [task](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation). Then run `task setup` & follow instructions until it says `‚úîÔ∏è you are setup`.

## Commands

Run `task` to see all possible commands.

## Contributing

Any PR to improve is welcome. [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) & [cursor](https://cursor.com) are nice for dev. Great **working** & **useful** patches are most appreciated (ideally). Issues with bugs or ideas are welcome too.
