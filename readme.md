# Config

See [this](https://nikiv.dev/config) for details.

I write lots of code and I describe my workflow [here](https://nikiv.dev/how-i-code).

I keep my [Karabiner](https://nikiv.dev/karabiner) config private but I built tool to manage the config nicely called [kar](https://github.com/nikivdev/kar).

This holds the public config I am sharing, internal stuff is in `i/` folder in here git ignored. 

I use [flow](https://github.com/nikivdev/flow) to manage everything.
